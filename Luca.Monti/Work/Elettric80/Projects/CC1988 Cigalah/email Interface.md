Dear all,

I hope you are all well;

I am writing to you to agree on dates and methods for the interface test for the new E80 CC1988 project.

When could we agree on a test session with your and our technicians to check communication and all required messages?

Since it has changed very little compared to the previous project, I expect it will not take long.

Since the servers are already installed and I have already verified that the connection with Ubiquity works and since, if I remember correctly, the servers will not be touched, you only need to enable ubiquity on your side and I will connect and prepare everything before running the tests, without touching the lgv manager so that the lgv batteries will continue to be chargedÂ as now

Thank you

Luca Monti
